This is simply an 'on top' mod of material-fox-updated for firefox.  I've extensively modified that theme in a somewhat modular way where I've just put my personal touches on most elements by improving the consistency of the UI and changed things that didn't look right to my eye.

Installation should be pretty straightforward if you're reading this:
1. use my user.js in your main firefox profile folder
2. install material-fox-updated by edelvarden
3. download all the files in this directory and put them in your /chrome/ folder

That's basically it.  I included the custom "userChrome.*" options in the user.js, so if you just type about:config and type in userchrome at the top there should be some themes and other things to choose from.
